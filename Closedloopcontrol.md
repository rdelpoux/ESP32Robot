## Required work 

### Modeling

- Propose a model which link the input voltage to the speed of the robot.

### Identification

- From a step response, identify the proposed model.

### Control 

The objective is to propose a speed control of the robot. 

- Based on the model identified, propose a control law making it possible to control the speed. 
- Based on the model identified, propose a control law making it possible to control the speed. You will propose specifications to be respected. 

- Using Matlab/Simulink, propose a simulation scheme and test the proposed control law.
- Apply the control law to the robot.
- Record the experimental data of the system, plot them on Simulink and discuss compliance with the specifications.
